#Excercise 1:
#Print function allows you to display string data

#Excercise 2:
#Using comments like the one's shown here with the '#' sign or triple quotes

#Excercise 3:
#Use comparison operators and outputting the value it returns
#   i.e (print 5 > 0) would print the value 'True'

#Excercise 4:
#Excercise focuses on assigning string or integer data to a variable and then implementing that variable into a print statement

#Excercise 5:
#Uses string formatting techniques to print data to make it easier to print data entered by the user
#i.e (Your name is %s) %name would print Your name is Josh

#Excercise 6:
#Showing that you can combine string data using the plus operator to create a concatentated print statement

#Excercise 7:
#Showing you can multiple a number by a string and it will create that string x amount of times
#Showing you can concatenate character by character and print the line with the plus operator to show that the characters were combined into single words

#Excercise 8:
#Integers and booleans do not contain quotes when using string formatting

#Excercise 9:
#Using basic escape sequences in python to display data in print statements
#i.e \n would take the string and then start a new line where that escape sequence was entered

#Excercise 10:
#Uses more escape sequences
#\t = tabbed indent, \n = new line, \\ = one backslash in print statement, which can also be used to insert quotes into a print statement

#Excercise 11:
#Uses casting, concatentation, string formatting and raw input to make a functional program from user input
#raw_input will allow user to enter information
#Allow info into raw_input is a string, so you can cast that string to other types ie int(var_name) or float(var_name)

#Excercise 12:
#Raw input with string formatting
#Note: For string formatting into a raw input string, you must add the modulo operator inside of the raw_input parenthesis

#Excercise 13:
#Programming allows more than 1 argument to be passed in the terminal. These arguments are used like variables throughout the program
# from sys import argv
# script_name, argument1, argument2 = argv

#Excercise 14:
#Reading and writing to files in Python
#   Open file:
#       file_open = open(filename, "w")
#   Close file:
#       file_open.close()
#   Read file:
#       print file_open.read()
#
#You can also print the bytes contained in the file using...
#       print len(file_open)

#Excercise 15:
#Using raw_input and conditional to make a functional reading and writing program
#Write to a file using:
#                       file_open = open(filename, "w")
#                       file_open.write(DATA_TO_WRITE_HERE)

#Excercise 16:
#Check if a file exists using:
#   from os.path import exists

#Excercise 17:
#print exists(FILE) >> would return a boolean inside of the print statement
#More basis file writing functions used in the previous excercise

#Excercise 18:
#Passing defined arguments into parameters of functions, concatenating them into a string and returning the values

#Excercise 19:
#Conditionals, functions and returns to keep track of integer counts, etc.

#Excerse 20:
#Defining functions to open, close and read files. (Combinations of function excercise with file writing excercise)

#Excercise 21:
#String concatenation using arguments, functions, returns and string formatting techniques

#Excercise 22:
#Fin
