This excercise in Python focuses on the main aspects of designing a program and debugging it.
Debugging a program isn't an optional skillset, it's a must when deploying an application to a user, company or other audience.
Debugging will help find logic errors in a program. Sometimes the debugging process of a program can be very tedious, but that 
is what makes a programmer better at his/her job.
